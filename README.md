# UCS_Satellite_Project
## Proposal
Perform data analysis on a satellite database, for our client who wants to start a space program. My analysis will give us an insight into the history and trends of the type of satellites that orbit earth today. We will help to answer questions such as; How many satellites a country has and what are they used for? What are the characteristics that distinguish satellites from each other? And what kind of satellites the client should launch to be with current trends?
